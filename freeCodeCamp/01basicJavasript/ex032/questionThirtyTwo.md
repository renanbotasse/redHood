Find the Length of a String
You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

console.log("Alan Peter".length);
The value 10 would be displayed in the console.

For example, if we created a variable const firstName = "Ada", we could find out how long the string Ada is by using the firstName.length property.

Use the .length property to count the number of characters in the lastName variable and assign it to lastNameLength.

You should not change the variable declarations in the // Setup section.

lastNameLength should be equal to eight.

You should be getting the length of lastName by using .length like this: lastName.length.
